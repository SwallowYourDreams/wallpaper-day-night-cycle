# wallpaper-day-night-cycle

This script sets up two cronjobs to cycle between two wallpapers at times specified by the user. The idea is to allow for a "day-time" and a "night-time" wallpaper that will automatically be exchanged.

# Usage

Run `wallpaper-day-night-cycle.sh`. It will prompt you for the wallpapers and times and set up the cronjobs for you.

# Dependencies

While there are no real dependencies that need to be fulfilled, the script will only work on Cinnamon DE for now. The idea is to make it more distro-agnostic in the future.
